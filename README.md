# Discord-Bot (2021 - date: "`r Sys.Date()`")


ðŸ”µ A simple Discord Music Bot with many other features.<br><br>

ðŸŸ£ You can listen to music and control the song in the format of a simple player with buttons accessed by react.<br>
ðŸŸ£ You can set to see the latest values of your favorite currencies and how they change depending on an available range.<br>
ðŸŸ£ You can be notified when your favorite streamer is live on twitch.<br>
ðŸŸ£ You can also set it to tell you your daily horoscope.<br>
ðŸŸ£ And many other things that are still in the works and inaccessible until completion.<br>
ðŸŸ£ The BOT does not come with pre-set things, like the daily horoscope, you have to set it, we do not force users to see something they do not want.<br>
ðŸŸ£ Initially it was just a simple BOT of music but over time other new ideas came and I started to add new things.<br>
