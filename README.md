# Discord-Bot


A simple Discord Music Bot with many other features.\n
You can listen to music and control the song in the format of a simple player with buttons accessed by react.\n
You can set to see the latest values of your favorite currencies and how they change depending on an available range.
You can be notified when your favorite streamer is live on twitch.
You can also set it to tell you your daily horoscope.
And many other things that are still in the works and inaccessible until completion.
The BOT does not come with pre-set things, like the daily horoscope, you have to set it, we do not force users to see something they do not want.
Initially it was just a simple BOT of music but over time other new ideas came and I started to add new things.

If you want to personally test this BOT here is an invitation: https://bit.ly/3pQJSDP
